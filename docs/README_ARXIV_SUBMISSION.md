## Abstract

We present the Houdinis Framework, an open-source quantum cryptography exploitation platform designed for comprehensive security assessment of cryptographic implementations in the post-quantum era. The framework implements quantum algorithms including Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, and Grover's algorithm for symmetric key search, providing practical tools for evaluating quantum vulnerabilities in current cryptographic systems.

## Key Contributions

1. **Comprehensive Framework**: First integrated platform combining quantum cryptanalysis algorithms with practical security assessment tools
2. **Multi-Backend Support**: Unified interface for IBM Quantum, local simulators, and GPU-accelerated quantum computing
3. **Risk Assessment Methodology**: Quantitative framework for evaluating quantum threats and migration planning
4. **Real-World Applications**: Practical tools for TLS/SSL, SSH, and IPsec security assessment
5. **Open Source**: Freely available platform encouraging research collaboration
