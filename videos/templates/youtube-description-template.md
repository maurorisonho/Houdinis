## A/B Testing Ideas

Test different elements to optimize performance:

- **Titles:** "Shor's Algorithm Tutorial" vs "Break RSA Encryption with Quantum Computing"
- **Thumbnails:** Code screenshot vs animated circuit vs person + code
- **Opening:** Start with demo vs start with explanation
- **Call-to-action:** Beginning, middle, or end of video
